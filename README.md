# EA-Assignment2

Two Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOGA and NSGA-II) for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are implemented in this repository. Reducing the overall distance traveled and enhancing route balance, as shown by the maximum route length or the standard deviation of route lengths, are the goals taken into consideration. The CVRPLIB dataset instances (A‑n32‑k5, B‑n78‑k10, and X‑n101‑k25) are used for testing, and the methods have been put into practice and examined in the notebook itself.

Just open Assignment2.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells one after the other to replicate the results.   Every function, algorithm, and charting technique is already present. Following execution, the notebook will produce the comparison analysis, convergence graphs, and Pareto fronts for both algorithms. Standard Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and tqdm are examples of dependencies. On GitHub, collaborators have the ability to modify the notebook, commit their modifications, and push to the main branch.
